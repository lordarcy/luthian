# World of Luthian

GURPS incursion campaign

1. This is a fantasy world with magic and multiple races. I'm resisting a technological campaign because I think it's easy to get lost in the minutiae of the environment.
2. The world gets incursions from other realities/planes/multiverse. These incursions bring in new races and cultures. This introduces the option to bring in alternate histories like an evolved Roman legion fighting Mongol horse archers. This is also a source of conflict in the campaign.
3. Almost all creatures have some magic. In humans this means most everyone has a magic power. In many it's useless (turning your hair green) but some have beneficial abilities. Other examples in increasing order of usefulness:
    * Keep flowers fresh
    * Stop someone's hair from growing
    * Keep food fresh
    * Keep an object's temperature constant
    * Create water
